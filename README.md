## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for running PostgreSQL)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ```

2. Set up HTTPS development certificate (Windows):
   ```bash
   # Generate HTTPS development certificate
   dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p password
   
   # Trust the certificate
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
   ```
   Note: Replace `password` with the same value as `ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password` in docker-compose.yml

3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose (recommended)
   docker-compose up

   # Or run directly with .NET
   dotnet run --project API
   ```

5. The API will be available at:
   - HTTP: http://localhost:5000
   - HTTPS: https://localhost:5001
